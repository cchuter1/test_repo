```

```{r}
#Suspension.data Variables
# schid = school code
# suspension_rate_total = suspension, count by school
# suspension_violent = violent suspension with injury, count by school
# suspension_violent_no_injury = violent suspension without injury, count by school
# suspension_weapon = weapon suspension, count by school
# suspension_drug = illicit drug suspension, count by school
# suspension_defiance = defiance suspension, count by school
# suspension_other = other reasons for suspension, count by school

```


```{r}
# Remove unnecessry columns
Suspension_Data <- subset( Suspension_Data, select = -c(1:4, 6:11,13:15))
View(Suspension_Data)

```


```{r}
names(Suspension_Data)[1:8] <- c("schid","suspension_rate_total", "suspension_violent", "suspension_violent_no_injury", "suspension_weapon", "suspension_drug", "suspension_defiance","suspension_other")
```

```{r}
# Check for a common identifier between the datasets
# Merge data by schid
merged_data <- merge(x = Demographic_Data,
                         y = Suspension_Data,
                         by = "schid",
                         all = FALSE)
```

```{r}
# What is the mean suspension rate for schools  overall?
mean(merged_data$suspension_rate_total,na.rm = T)

# What is the mean suspension rate for schools with farms > 100? 
mean(merged_data$suspension_rate_total[merged_data$farms > 100], na.rm = T)

# What is the mean suspension rate for schools with farms < 100? 
mean(merged_data$suspension_rate_total[merged_data$farms < 100], na.rm = T)

## Nothing too interesting here, I had hypothesized that schools with fewer farms would have higher suspension rates, but that seems to not be the case.
