```{r}
# Import & Rename SF Data
View(SF_Data)
SF_Data_1 <-read.csv("SF_Data.csv", TRUE, ",")
SF_Data_1
```

```{r}
## Exploratory Data Analysis Plan
# Merge Demographic Data (SF_Data_1), with Suspension Data (SF_Data_2)
# Analyze suspension by enrollment, farms, and ELL populations
```

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
